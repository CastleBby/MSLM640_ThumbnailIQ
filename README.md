# ThumbnailIQ:
ThumbnailIQ is a computer vision application designed to perform visual similarity search on YouTube thumbnails using classical feature detection (ORB keypoints).  


## Overview:  

Given a query thumbnail, the system retrieves visually similar thumbnails from a dataset by matching keypoint features. The project also evaluates how well this matching process performs under real-world distortions such as resizing, compression, blur, and noise.

This simulates a practical scenario where images are viewed across different devices and quality conditions, testing whether classical computer vision methods remain reliable for visual search tasks.

## Problem: 
Content creators often want to understand:
	- What thumbnails look visually similar to theirs
	- What design patterns are common across videos
	- How their thumbnail compares stylistically within a dataset

Modern systems (e.g., reverse image search) rely on deep learning, but this project explores:

Can classical computer vision (keypoint-based matching) be used to perform thumbnail similarity search under real-world conditions?

## How to run the demo:  

0. All in one script that bypasses steps 1 - 6 
- user must input path to their image they are testing in "data/raw/images/..."

`bash scripts/run_pipeline.sh data/raw/images/_fXpf-qBca4.jpg`

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
```

2. install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. data collection 
```bash
python src/data_collection/youtube_collector.py
```

4. download images

```bash
python src/preprocessing/download_thumbnails.py
```

5. optional feature extraction
```bash
python src/features/extract_features.py
```

6. run the application 
run similarity search 
**user inputs their image here**
```bash
python demo/run_similarity.py data/raw/images/<image_name>.jpg
```

## Broad logic flow:  

YouTube API -> Thumbnail URL -> Download -> Image -> Keypoint Detection -> Matching -> Similarity Ranking 

Given an input thumbnail, ThumbnailIQ:
	1.	Extracts keypoints using ORB
	2.	Compares the query image to a dataset of thumbnails
	3.	Computes similarity using keypoint matching
	4.	Returns the most visually similar thumbnails

Additionally, the system applies real-world transformations to evaluate:
	- Whether similar images remain detectable under distortion
	- When and why matching begins to fail


## Reproducibility 
The API calls and collects video meta-data based on the past year from the date ran. Therefore, to reproduce the same results as used in my analysis, the user must input a static date of March 30, 2026. 

**System Dependencies** this project uses OCR features via Tesseract OCT 
install on mac terminal using `brew install tesseract`  

## How to run:  

**note:** if the order is not specified then API defaults to "relevance"
    this is Youtube's internal ranking most relevant to the search query

## Important Notes:  
- Youtue Data API v3  
10,000 quota units per day for free  
python scripy `youtube_collector.py` returns 403 error past quota   

- youtube_collector.py 
API script does not collect data on watch time, click through rate, or impressions. 
Therefore engagement is based on views, likes, and comments.  

- Youtube Metrics clarified:  
    - views (in data) = how many times users clicked and watched the video  
    - watch time (not in data) = how long users stayed watching after clicking  
    - impressions (not in data)  = how many times youtube showed thumbnail to users  
    Youtube optimizes for watch time and retention
